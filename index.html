<h1>NBAD Balance Inquiry Online Guide</h1>

<p>
NBAD Balance Inquiry Online Guide explains how account holders in the UAE
can check NBAD (now FAB) account balances using official and commonly used
methods. This page provides clear steps and options for balance inquiry
without having to visit a branch.
</p>

<h2>What Is NBAD Balance Inquiry</h2>

<p>
NBAD balance inquiry refers to checking the available funds in an NBAD
account through digital services provided by the bank. Since NBAD merged
with First Abu Dhabi Bank (FAB), most services are integrated into FAB’s
systems.
</p>

<h2>Available Methods to Check Account Balance</h2>

<p>
There are multiple ways to check NBAD or FAB account balance. Account
holders can use online banking, the official mobile application, ATMs,
telephone banking, or visit a branch for assistance. Choose the method
that best suits your convenience.
</p>

<h3>Online Banking</h3>

<p>
Users with online banking credentials can log in to the FAB internet banking
portal to view their account balance and recent transactions. This is
one of the fastest ways to check balance information securely.
</p>

<h3>Mobile Banking App</h3>

<p>
The FAB mobile app allows you to check your balance on the go. Download the
official app from your device’s app store, sign in with your credentials,
and select the account to see the balance instantly.
</p>

<h3>ATMs and Telephone Banking</h3>

<p>
You can also check your account balance at any FAB or NBAD associated ATM
by inserting your debit card and entering your PIN. Telephone banking is
another option where you can call the official number and follow prompts
to hear your balance.
</p>

<h2>Important Tips for Secure Balance Inquiry</h2>

<p>
Always use official banking channels to check your balance and avoid
entering sensitive information on third-party websites or apps. Keep your
login credentials confidential and update passwords regularly for security.
